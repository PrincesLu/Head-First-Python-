## Chapter 2 - List Data

#### All programs process data, and Python programs are no exception.
In fact, take a look around: data is everywhere. A lot of, if not most, programming is all about 
data: acquiring data, processing data, understanding data. To work with data effectively, you need 
somewhere to put your data when processing it. Python shines in this regard, thanks (in no small 
part) to its inclusion of a handful of widely applicable data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples, and 
sets. In this chapter, we’ll preview all four, before spending the majority of this chapter digging deeper 
into lists (and we’ll deep-dive into the other three in the next chapter). We’re covering these data 
structures early, as most of what you’ll likely do with Python will revolve around working with data.
