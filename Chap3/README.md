## Chapter 3 - Structured Data

#### Python’s list data structure is great, but it isn’t a data panacea.
When you have truly structured data (and using a list to store it may not be the best 
choice), Python comes to your rescue with its built-in dictionary. Out of the box, the 
dictionary lets you store and manipulate any collection of key/value pairs. We look long 
and hard at Python’s dictionary in this chapter, and—along the way—meet set and tuple, 
too. Together with the list (which we met in the previous chapter), the dictionary, set, and 
tuple data structures provide a set of built-in data tools that help to make Python and data 
a powerful combination
