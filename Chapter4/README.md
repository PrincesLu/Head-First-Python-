## Chaper 4 - Code Reuse - Functions and Modules 

##### Reusing code is key to building a maintainable system.
And when it comes to reusing code in Python, it all starts and ends with the humble 
function. Take some lines of code, give them a name, and you’ve got a function (which 
can be reused). Take a collection of functions and package them as a file, and you’ve 
got a module (which can also be reused). It’s true what they say: it’s good to share, and 
by the end of this chapter, you’ll be well on your way to sharing and reusing your code, 
thanks to an understanding of how Python’s functions and modules work.
